I solved the problem using grover's algorithm. Initially I made an oracle for the cases given in the question using initially a matrix for given conditions and then converting it into an operator. Then I used this along with reflect for approximately square root n times to get the solution and various possibilities of sending invitations frank had. Grover's used the oracle to amplify the amplitude of possible cases and at the end we got high probabilities for the possible cases.
